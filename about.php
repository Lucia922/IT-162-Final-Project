        <p>
            Ruku Svelo,roughly translated from Russian,means "Blossoming hand."
            My two daughters are the inspiration behind my designs.
            I want my daughters to lead beautiful lives,
            to enjoy sophisticated aesthetics,
            and to be able to navigate emotional complexity.

            I have been dreaming of children's clothes that are
            classic, sturdy, comfortable, simple, wholesome, and honest.
            Ruku Svelo celebrates traditions, the passage of time,
            and the far-away future.

        <h3> About </h3>
        <p>
            The birth of Ruku Svelo began with my mother-in-law Ella's wardrobe,
            which is full of linen dresses, wool stockings, hand-printed cottons,
            hand-knitted sweaters, and the old, soft, worn textures of Soviet Russia.

            As a designer, I worked for ten years in women's apparel.
            But I quit fast fashion and throw-away culture.
            Now most of my designs are one-offs, made from rare fabrics,
            hand-selected for quality, designed to be passed down through several generations.

            I live with my husband and two daughters in Maine.
            We are surrounded by water, mountains,
            and evergreen forests.
