        <p>
            Ruku Svelo,<br> roughly translated from Russian,<br> means "Blossoming hand."</br> 
            My two daughters are the inspiration behind my designs.</br>
            I want my daughters to lead beautiful lives,</br>
            to enjoy sophisticated aesthetics,</br>
            and to be able to navigate emotional complexith.</br>
                                                
            I have been dreaming of children's clothes that are</br>
            classic, sturdy, comfortable, simple, wholesome, and honest.</br>
            Ruku Svelo celebrates traditions, the passage of time,</br>
            and the far-away future.

    <h3 class="about">About</h3>
        <p>
            The birth of Ruku Svelo began<br> with my mother-in-law Ella's wardrobe,<br>
            which is full of linen dresses, wool stockings,<br> hand-printed cottons,
            hand-knitted sweaters,<br> and the old, soft, worn textures of Soviet Russia.<br>
                                                                    
            As a designer, I worked for ten years in women's apparel.<br>
            But I quit fast fashion and throw-away culture.<br>
            Now most of my designs are one-offs,<br> made from rare fabrics,<br>
            hand-selected for quality,<br>designed to be passed down through several generations.<br>
             
            I live with my husband and two daughters in Maine.<br>
            We are surrounded by water, mountains,<br>
            and evergreen forests.
